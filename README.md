# Python-CMS
This project is a Content Management System (CMS) with an integrated Audit Trail, developed using Python Flask to effectively manage and organise web content. The CMS provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to create, edit, and manage various types of content while maintaining full control over access permissions.

Built upon the foundation of the Python-RBAC-Lab project, it incorporates a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, ensuring that different user roles have appropriate access and permissions within the platform. This allows for a secure and scalable system where user actions are restricted based on their roles.

The integrated Audit Trail feature ensures transparency and accountability by tracking all user activities within the CMS. Every content change, user action, and permission modification is logged, providing a complete history that can be reviewed for security and compliance purposes. This combination of features makes the CMS not only versatile but also secure and reliable for managing dynamic web content.
